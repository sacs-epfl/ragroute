In Euripides's \"Bacchae\", Dionysus carries out his dances and rites with his bacchants, his priestesses, on Cithaeron. Oedipus was exposed on"], ["\"East Midlands\"", "1955. During the war he invented the cavity resonance wavemeter to find the first accurate value of the speed of light. The atomic clock works on differences in magnetic spin. Before Essen's invention, the second was defined in terms of the orbit of the Earth round the Sun; he changed it in 1967 to be based on the hyperfine structure of the caesium-133 atom. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), in Paris, takes the average of 300 atomic clocks around the world. The East Midlands colloquially use a distinctive form of spoken dialect and accent in some areas. It also has some"], ["\"Gunnison's prairie dog\"", "prairie dog are diurnal. This means they exert the most activity in the early morning and late afternoon. During warm weather, the highest activity levels occur at about 9 a.m., and from 2 p.m. to about an hour before the sun sets. When the temperature starts to cool, they become more active during the day. When it snows or rains, the prairie dogs will stay underground. Their above-ground activities include making social contact, being aware of their surroundings and predators, grooming, burrowing, etc. Their main activity above ground is feeding. Although Gunnison's prairie dogs are considered to be less social"], ["\"Chinchaga fire\"", "by themselves, and drivers resorted to automobile headlights during daytime hours. In Toronto power consumption increased by 200,000 kWh during the smoke event. This caused power failures which in turn set off bank alarms - responding police cars, sirens pealing, added to the tension of the day. Aircraft were grounded, and an aerial search for a downed United States military plane was delayed by the smoke. Animals also felt the effects; cows required milking at different times, and birds were seen bedding down midday. To the good, the smoke blanket held off a killing frost expected in southern Ontario, saving"], ["\"West Midlands (region)\"", "the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1971. James Glaisher in 1862 took a record balloon flight with Henry Tracey Coxwell for the BAAS near Wolverhampton. They reached the composition of the Earth's atmosphere until then was not understood; the altitude records for the UK have not been exceeded since; Project Excelsior in the US in 1960 would later reach . Philip Lawley of Burton upon Trent was first person to realise that chemical damage to DNA caused cancer (at the Chester Beatty Research Institute in London) in the early 1960s.

Temperatures fluctuate greatly, on both a seasonal and a daily basis, with mean maximum and minimum temperatures of 35,7 \u00b0C and 19,5 \u00b0C in January and 22,2 \u00b0C and 1,2 \u00b0C in July. Rainfall is unreliable and irregular, falling primarily during short-duration, high intensity thunderstorms between November and April. Before the rainy season begins, strong northwesterly winds blow between September and November, producing dust storms. Mean annual precipitation is approximately 223mm. Humidity is low and evaporation high, the latter resulting in the characteristically large deficit in the annual water budget. River water tends to"], ["\"Whillans Ice Stream\"", "by the National Science Foundation, reported in the June 5, 2008 issue of the journal \"Nature\" that, from seismological and GPS data, they discovered the Whillans Ice Stream releases two bursts of seismic waves every day, each one equivalent to a magnitude 7 earthquake. The data show that the river of ice moves about a half-meter within approximately 30 minutes, remains still for 12 hours, then moves another half-meter, seemingly in phase with gravitational tides. Each time it moves, it emits seismic waves that are recorded at seismographs around Antarctica and even as far away as Australia, a distance of"], ["\"Central place foraging\"", "diets. Using foraging data from the Meriam of Australia, Bird and Bliege Bird (1997) compare observed shellfish field acquisition to shell deposition at residential sites, and test the hypotheses of the CPF model. The Meriam inhabit Torres Strait Islands of Australia, are of Melanesian descent, and have strong cultural and historical ties to New Guinea. They continue to harvest marine resources such as sea turtles, fishes, squid, and shellfish. Bird and Bliege Bird conducted \u201cfocal individual foraging follows\u201d of 33 children, 16 men and 42 women during intertidal foraging bouts on reef flats and rock shores.
