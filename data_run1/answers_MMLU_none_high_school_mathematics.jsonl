{"question_id": "4245", "answer": "A polynomial of degree $2$ has no terms of degree higher than $2$.  The expansion of $(x^2+5x+6)^2$ will have a term with degree $4$, so it must be canceled out by the other factor.  This means that the coefficient of the $x^4$ term in $(px+q)(x^3+7x^2+3x)$ is zero, which implies that $p=0$.  The constant term in this product is $q(0)=0$, so we must have $q=0$ as well.  Therefore, the sum of $p$ and $q$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nHowever, since none of the answer choices are zero, let's re-examine our work.  We made an error in assuming that $(px+q)(x^3+7x^2+3x)$ must cancel out the term with degree $4$.  Instead, we should look at the terms of lowest degree.  The constant term in the expansion is $6^2=36$, and the constant term in the product $(px+q)(x^3+7x^2+3x)$ is $qx^3$, so these must cancel out as well.  This implies that $q=0$.  Similarly, the linear term in the expansion of $(x^2+5x+6)^2$ is $10x+12$, and the linear term in the product $(px+q)(x^3+7x^2+3x)$ is $(p)(3x)+(q)(7x^2)$.

The area of the rectangle can be calculated by multiplying its base (3) by its height (2), which equals 6.\n\nTo find the probability that $x < y$, we need to determine the ratio of the area where $x < y$ to the total area of the rectangle. This region is a triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(0,2)$, and $(2,2)$. The area of this triangle can be calculated by multiplying its base (2) by its height (2), which equals 4.\n\nThe probability that $x < y$ is therefore $\\frac{4}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}.$\n\nThe best answer is C."}

{"question_id": "4301", "answer": "To solve this problem, we can start by expanding the given equation $(2x + 3y)^2 = 4$ using the formula $(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2$. This gives us:\n\n$(2x + 3y)^2 = (2x)^2 + 2(2x)(3y) + (3y)^2$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 = 4$\n\nWe are also given that $xy = -5$. We can substitute this into the equation above to get:\n\n$4x^2 + 12(-5) + 9y^2 = 4$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$4x^2 - 60 + 9y^2 = 4$\n\nNow, let's rearrange the terms and add $60$ to both sides of the equation:\n\n$4x^2 + 9y^2 = 64$\n\nThe question asks for the value of $4x^2 + 9y^2$, which we have found to be equal to $64$.

{"question_id": "4302", "answer": "A sequence of three real numbers forms an arithmetic progression with a first term of 9. Let the common difference be d and the third term be 9 + 2d.\n\nIf 2 is added to the second term and 20 is added to the third term, the resulting terms form a geometric progression: (9, 11 + d, 29 + 2d).\n\nSince this forms a geometric progression, we have that (11 + d)^2 = 9(29 + 2d). Expanding gives:\n\n121 + 22d + d^2 = 261 + 18d\n\nSubtracting 121 and 18d from both sides gives:\n\n4d^2 - 4d - 140 = 0\n\nDividing by 4 gives:\n\nd^2 - d - 35 = 0\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation gives:\n\n(d - 7)(d + 5) = 0\n\nThis means that either d = 7 or d = -5.\n\nIf d = 7, then the third term of the geometric progression is 29 + 2(7) = 43. If d = -5, then the third term of the geometric progression is 29 + 2(-5) = 19.\n\nThe smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression is therefore 19, which corresponds to answer choice D.\n\nThe best answer is D."}

{"question_id": "4342", "answer": "To solve for x, we can start by rewriting both sides of the equation in terms of the same base.\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right)^{x + 2} = 125^{-x}$$\n\nWe know that $\\frac{1}{25}$ can be written as $5^{-2}$ and $125$ can be written as $5^3$. So, we have:\n\n$$(5^{-2})^{x+2}=(5^3)^{-x}$$\n\nUsing the property of exponents $(a^m)^n=a^{mn}$, we get:\n\n$$5^{-2(x+2)}=5^{-3x}$$\n\nSince both sides have the same base (5), their exponents must be equal. So, we can set up an equation:\n\n$$-2(x+2)=-3x$$\n\nSimplifying this equation gives us:\n\n$$-2x-4=-3x$$\n\nSubtracting $-2x$ from both sides gives us:\n\n$$-4=-x$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by -1, we get:\n\n$$4=x$$\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 4.\n\nThe best answer is D."}

{"question_id": "4355", "answer": "To find the length of the curve y = ln x between the points where y = 1/2 and y = 1, we need to use the formula for the arc length of a curve:\n\nL = \u222b[a,b] \u221a(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of y with respect to x:\n\ndy/dx = 1/x\n\nNow, substitute this into the formula:\n\nL = \u222b[a,b] \u221a(1 + (1/x)^2) dx\n= \u222b[a,b] \u221a(1 + 1/x^2) dx\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we need to find the limits of integration. The points where y = 1/2 and y = 1 correspond to x = e^(1/2) and x = e^1, respectively.\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\nL = \u222b[e^(1/2), e^1] \u221a(1 + 1/x^2) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use a substitution. Let u = x^2, then du/dx = 2x, or du = 2x dx.\n\nSubstituting this into the integral, we get:\n\nL = (1/2) \u222b[e^(1/2)^2, e^1^2] \u221a(1 + 1/u) du\n\nNow, let's evaluate the limits of integration. When x = e^(1/2), u = (e^(1/2))^2 = e^1. When x = e^1, u = (e^1)^2 = e^2.\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\nL = (1/2) \u222b[e^1, e^2] \u221a(1 + 1/u) du\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we can use a trigonometric substitution. Let's substitute u = tan \u03b8, then du/d\u03b8 = sec^2 \u03b8.\n\nSubstituting this into the integral, we get:\n\nL = (1/2) \u222b[arctan(e^1), arctan(e^2)] \u221a(1 + 1/tan \u03b8) sec^2 \u03b8 d\u03b8\n\nNow, let's simplify the integrand. We can rewrite it as:\n\n\u221a(1 + 1/tan \u03b8) = \u221a((tan^2 \u03b8 + 1)/tan \u03b8)\n= (tan \u03b8 + 1)/\u221atan \u03b8\n\nSubstituting this into the integral, we get:\n\nL = (1/2) \u222b[arctan(e^1), arctan(e^2)] ((tan \u03b8 + 1)/\u221atan \u03b8) sec^2 \u03b8 d\u03b8\n\nNow, let's simplify the integrand. We can rewrite it as:\n\n(tan \u03b8 + 1)/\u221atan \u03b8 = (tan \u03b8 + 1)/(tan^(1/2) \u03b8)\n\nSubstituting this into the integral, we get:\n\nL = (1/2) \u222b[arctan(e^1), arctan(e^2)] ((tan \u03b8 + 1)/(tan^(1/2) \u03b8)) sec^2 \u03b8 d\u03b8\n\nNow, let's simplify the integrand. We can rewrite it as:\n\n(tan \u03b8 + 1)/(tan^(1/2) \u03b8) = (tan^(3/2) \u03b8 + tan^(1/2) \u03b8)\n\nSubstituting this into the integral, we get:\n\nL = (1/2) \u222b[arctan(e^1), arctan(e^2)] ((tan^(3/2) \u03b8 + tan^(1/2) \u03b8)) sec^2 \u03b8 d\u03b8\n\nNow, let's simplify the integrand. We can rewrite it as:\n\n(tan^(3/2) \u03b8 + tan^(1/2) \u03b8) = (u^(3/4) + u^(1/4})\n\nSubstituting this into the integral, we get:\n\nL = (1/2) \u222b[arctan(e^1), arctan(e^2)] ((u^(3/4) + u^(1/4)) du\n\nNow, let's evaluate the integral. We can use the power rule of integration to integrate each term separately.\n\n\u222b(u^(3/4) du = (4/5)u^(5/4)\n\u222b(u^(1/4) du = (4/3)u^(3/4)\n\nEvaluating these integrals at the limits, we get:\n\nL = (1/2) [(4/5)(e^2)^(5/4) - (4/5)(e^1)^(5/4) + (4/3)(e^2)^(3/4) - (4/3)(e^1)^(3/4)]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nL = 0.86\n\nThe best answer is B."}

Then \\begin{align*}\nx^2+xy+y^2+n &amp;=(7a+3)^2+(7a+3)(7b-3)+(7b-3)^2+n\\\\\n&amp;=49a^2+42a+9+49ab-21a+21b-9+49b^2-42b+9+n\\\\\n&amp;=(49a^2+49ab+49b^2)+(42a-21a)+(21b-42b)+n+(9-9)\\\\\n&amp;=49(a^2+ab+b^2)-21a-21b+n.\n\\end{align*}Since $49(a^2+ab+b^2)$ is a multiple of $7$, we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $-21a-21b+n$ is a multiple of $7$.  Since $-21a-21b$ is a multiple of $7$, it follows that $n$ must be a multiple of $7$.  The smallest positive multiple of $7$ is $\\boxed{7}$, but this is not among the answer choices. However, we can subtract multiples of $7$ from $7$ to obtain smaller numbers which are also multiples of $7$, and since $-21a-21b$ is a multiple of $7$, it follows that $n=7-7=\\boxed{0}$ will work, but this is not among the answer choices either.  However, we can add $7$ to $0$ to obtain $\\boxed{7}$.  Since $7$ is not an option, we must subtract a multiple of $7$ from it.  The only choice that works is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }2}$.\nThe best answer is A"}

{"question_id": "4437", "answer": "A geometric sequence has the form $a, ar, ar^{2}, \\ldots, ar^{n-1}$.  The terms of this sequence have the same number of digits if and only if they are all in the same range of values.  Since we want to maximize the number of terms with the same number of digits, we should choose $a$ as small as possible so that it is a single digit (so that there are many terms with one digit), then two digits, then three digits, and so on.  We can do this by choosing $a=1$.  Now, if we want to maximize the number of terms with the same number of digits, we should choose $r$ as large as possible.  Since $r>1$, the largest value for $r$ is $9$.  The first few terms of the sequence are then $$1, 9, 81, 729, \\ldots$$We can see that there are four one-digit numbers, three two-digit numbers, and so on.
